# Unemployment Analysis With Python 📊

## Oasis Infobyte Internship - July P2 Batch

### Data Science Intern: Rupa Navale 👩‍💻

This repository contains the code and documentation for a data science project aimed at exploring the impact of Covid-19 lockdown on employment opportunities and analyzing the resulting surge in the unemployment rate. The project involves using Python and data visualization libraries to perform exploratory data analysis on unemployment rate data.

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this project is to investigate the influence of the Covid-19 lockdown on the employment landscape in various regions of India. By analyzing unemployment rate data, we aim to identify trends, regional variations, and potential insights into the economic impact of the pandemic.

## 📚 Project Structure

The project is structured into several key steps, including:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Importing the necessary Python libraries, including numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and plotly.express.

2. **Loading and Exploring the Dataset**: Loading the dataset containing information about unemployment rates, labor participation, and geographical information.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and organizing the dataset, renaming columns, converting data types, and creating new columns for analysis.

4. **Data Visualization**: Creating various visualizations to gain insights into the unemployment trends, regional disparities, and more.

5. **Conclusion**: Summarizing the findings and insights obtained from the exploratory data analysis.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the code and reproduce the results of this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/rupanavale/OIBSIP-Task-2`.

2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the project code and run the cells or the script to execute the project steps.

4. Explore the visualizations and conclusions drawn from the analysis to better understand the impact of Covid-19 on unemployment.

## 📊 Results and Insights

Based on the exploratory data analysis and visualizations of the unemployment rate data, several insights were drawn:

- Urban Areas: Higher unemployment rates are observed in urban areas, possibly due to factors like population density and competition for limited job opportunities.

- Regional Variation: The southern region of India has a higher average unemployment rate, which could be influenced by economic and industrial variations.

- States with Highest Unemployment Rates: States like Haryana, Tripura, Jharkhand, Bihar, and Delhi have the highest average unemployment rates, potentially due to specific economic challenges.

## 🎉 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analysis and visualization techniques can be used to gain insights into the impact of the Covid-19 lockdown on employment opportunities. By utilizing Python and visualization libraries, we were able to identify trends and regional disparities in unemployment rates.

Feel free to explore the code and documentation in this repository to gain insights into the exploratory data analysis process and the findings.
